# Walkthrough: RAG-Based Text Summarizer & QA System

I have successfully built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows you to upload documents, generate high-quality summaries, and ask questions using Google's Gemini LLM and FAISS vector search.

## Features Implemented

- **Dual-Mode RAG Pipeline**: Specialized logic for both summarization (handling long contexts via map-reduce) and specific question-answering.
- **FAISS Vector Storage**: Fast local similarity search for retrieving relevant context.
- **Gemini Integration**: Uses `embedding-001` for high-dimensional text embeddings and `gemini-1.5-flash` for low-latency, reliable generation.
- **Latency Tracking**: Real-time performance metrics for indexing, summarization, and QA.
- **Clean UI**: A Streamlit interface designed for ease of use.

## Project Structure

- [app.py](file:///Users/pranjal/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/rag-summarizer/app.py): The main Streamlit dashboard.
- [rag_logic.py](file:///Users/pranjal/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/rag-summarizer/rag_logic.py): Core RAG engine using LangChain.
- [requirements.txt](file:///Users/pranjal/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/rag-summarizer/requirements.txt): Python dependencies.

## How to Run

1. **Obtain a Gemini API Key**:
   Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and create a free API key.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/pranjal/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/rag-summarizer
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Interact**:
   - Paste your API key in the sidebar.
   - Upload any PDF or TXT file.
   - Click **Index Document**.
   - Use the **Generate Summary** button or the **QA** input to explore your document.

## Evaluation Notes

- **Latency**: Indexing is typically instantaneous for standard documents. Generation latency is optimized by using the `gemini-1.5-flash` model.
- **Reliability**: The system uses `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with overlap to ensure context is preserved across chunks, improving the relevance of retrieved information.
